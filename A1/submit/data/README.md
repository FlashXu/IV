# GEOM90007 Information Visualisation Assignment 1
### 1. Plotting Description
##### Note: please extract the .csv files and put them in the same path with the R script.
The Data is coming from:  
(1) https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/tree/master/nba-raptor
(2) https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2020-nba-player-ratings/

We obtained the RAPTOR data from (1) and the team and position information of each player from (2). Then we filtered the data and selected top 5 players by RAPTOR value from high to low for each position. Finally we made the barchart as the pdf shows.

### 2. About the RAPTOR
(1) RAPTOR, which stands for Robust Algorithm (using) Player Tracking (and) On/Off Ratings, is FiveThirtyEight’s new NBA statistic.
(2) RAPTOR consists of two major components that are blended together to rate players: a “box” (as in “box score”) component, which uses individual statistics (including statistics derived from player tracking and play-by-play data), and an “on-off” component, which evaluates a team’s performance when the player and various combinations of his teammates are on or off the floor.
